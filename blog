My friend Simon Holgate of <a
href="http://sealevelresearch.com/">Sea Level Research</a> has recently
"cursed" me by introducing me to tides and sea-level data. Now
I'm hooked. Why are tides interesting? When you're trying to
navigate a super-tanker into the San Francisco Bay and you only
have few centimetres of clearance, whether the tide is in or out
could be quite important!

The French port of Brest has the longest historical tidal
record. The Joint Archive for Sea Level has hourly readings from
1846. Those of you wanting to follow along at home should get
the code:

    git clone git://github.com/drj11/sea-level-tool.git
    cd sea-level-tool
    virtualenv .
    pip install -r requirements.txt

After that lot (phew!), you can get the data for Brest by going:

    code/etl 822a

Tide data can be surprisingly complex (the 486 pages of
[<a href="http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/19157/1/sea-level.pdf">PUGH1987</a>]
are testimony to that), but in essence we have a time
series of heights, <var>z</var>. Often even really simple
analyses can tell us interesting facts about the data.

Consider a straightforward histogram:

The data is a height reading every hour, so the histogram shows
us the most common (and least common) height values. Clearly
there are two humps: In other words two heights are more
commonly observed than all others.
These are the mean low tide, and the mean
high tide. The range, the distance between mean low tide and
mean high tide, is about 2.5 metres. Sea level is measured to
some particular fixed 0-point, in this case (as is common) a
point chosen so that it is the lowest sea level (either observed
or predicted) over some period, so that almost all actual
observations are positive. You can't tell from the histogram but
the record for Brest does in fact include a few negative values.

Now look at the histogram for St Helena (where Napoleon was kept
prisoner):

Notice the change in x-scale. Again showing a mean low tide and
a mean high tide, but this time the range is about 0.4 metres,
and the entire record including extremes fits into 1.5 metres.
St Helena is a rock in the middle of a large ocean, and this
small range is typical of the oceanic tides. It's the shallow
waters of a continental shelf, and complex basin dynamics in
northwest Europe (and Kelvin waves, see
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQPpPhxqPxY">Lucy's IgniteLiverpool</a>
talk for more details) that gives ports like Brest a high tidal
range.

It is not clear what the 0-point on the St Helena chart is (it's
clearly not a low low water, and doesn't look like a mean water
level either), and I have exhausted the budget for researching the
matter.

In locations like Fremantle instead of 2
tides a day (semi-diurnal) we get just 1 tide a day (diurnal):

The diurnal tides are produced predominantly by the effect of lunar
declination. When the moon crosses the equator (twice a nodical month)
the diurnal tides reduce to nearly zero. This is in contrast to the
twice-daily tides familiar to our beaches in the UK which while we have
large (spring) and small (neap) tides, we still get tides whatever time
of the month it is.  Because of the modulation of the diurnal tide there
is no "mean low tide" and "mean high tide", tides of all heights are
produced, and we get a single, skew, hump in the distribution.
