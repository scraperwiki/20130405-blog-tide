My friend Simon Holgate of <a
href="http://sealevelresearch.com/">Sea Level Research</a> has recently
"cursed" me by introducing me to tides and sea-level data. Now
I'm hooked. Why are tides interesting? When you're trying to
navigate a super-tanker into San Francisco Bay and you only
have few centimetres of clearance, whether the tide is in or out
could be quite important!

The French port of Brest has the longest historical tidal
record. The Joint Archive for Sea Level has hourly readings from
1846. Those of you wanting to follow along at home should get
the code:

    git clone git://github.com/drj11/sea-level-tool.git
    cd sea-level-tool
    virtualenv .
    pip install -r requirements.txt

After that lot (phew!), you can get the data for Brest by going:

    code/etl 822a

The sea level tool is written in Python and uses our
<a href="http://github.com/scraperwiki/scraperwiki-python">scraperwiki</a>
library to store the sea level data in a sqlite database.

Tide data can be surprisingly complex (the 486 pages of
[<a href="http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/19157/1/sea-level.pdf">PUGH1987</a>]
are testimony to that), but in essence we have a time
series of heights, <var>z</var>. Often even really simple
analyses can tell us interesting facts about the data.

As Ian tells us, <a
href="http://blog.scraperwiki.com/2013/03/27/book-review-r-in-action-by-robert-i-kabacoff/">R is good for visualisations</a>. And it turns out
it has an installable RSQLite package that can load R dataframes
from a sqlite file. And I feel like a grown-up data scientist when
I use R. The relevant snippet of R is:

    library(RSQLite)
    db <- dbConnect(dbDriver("SQLite"), dbname='scraperwiki.sqlite', loadable.extensions=TRUE)
    bre <- dbGetQuery(db, "SELECT*FROM obs WHERE jaslid=='h822a' ORDER BY t")

I'm sure you're all aware that the sea level goes up and down to make
<var>tides</var> and some tides are bigger than others. Here's a typical
month at Brest (1999-01):


There are well over 1500 months of data for Brest. Can we summarise the data?
A histogram works well:

Remember that this is a histogram of hourly sea level observations.
So the two humps show the most frequent sea level heights that
appear in the hourly series. These are clustered around two
heights that are more commonly observed than all others.
These are the <var>mean low tide</var>, and the <var>mean
high tide</var>.
The <var>range</var>, the distance between mean low tide and
mean high tide, is about 2.5 metres (big tides, big data!). This
is a comparitively large range, certainly compared to a site
like St Helena (where the British imprisoned
Napoleon after his defeat at Waterloo):

Again showing a mean low tide and
a mean high tide, but this time the range is about 0.4 metres,
and the entire span of observed heights including extremes fits into 1.5 metres.
St Helena is a rock in the middle of a large ocean, and this
small range is typical of the oceanic tides. It's the shallow
waters of a continental shelf, and complex basin dynamics in
northwest Europe (and Kelvin waves, see
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQPpPhxqPxY">Lucy's IgniteLiverpool</a>
talk for more details) that gives ports like Brest a high tidal
range.

Notice that St Helena has some <em>negative</em> sea levels.
Sea level is measured to a 0-point that is fixed for each
station but varies from station to station.
It is common to pick that point as
being the lowest sea level (either observed
or predicted) over some period, so that almost all actual
observations are positive. Brest follows the usual convention,
almost all the observations are positive (you can't tell from the
histogram but there are a few negative ones).
It is not clear what the 0-point on the St Helena chart is (it's
clearly not a low low water, and doesn't look like a mean water
level either), and I have exhausted the budget for researching the
matter.

Tides are a new subject for me, and when I was reading Pugh's book one
of the first surprises was the existence of places that do not get
two tides a day. An example is Fremantle, Australia, which instead
of getting two tides a day (semi-diurnal) gets just one tide a day (diurnal):


The diurnal tides are produced predominantly by the effect of lunar
declination. When the moon crosses the equator (twice a nodical month)
the diurnal tides reduce to nearly zero. This is in contrast to the
twice-daily tides which while they exhibit large (spring) and small
(neap) tides, we still get tides whatever time of the month it is.
Because of the modulation of the diurnal tide there is no "mean low tide"
and "mean high tide", tides of all heights are produced, and we get a
single, skew, hump in the distribution:
